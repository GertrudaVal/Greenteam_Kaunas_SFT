Automation testing homework SFT

Hello. :D

The repository is made from scratch because the one I made during class turned into a huge mess.
Build 0 is prototype build.
Build 9 is hilarious.
First I turned all meth functions into methods but one test should just do one thing, so I left that out.

Added forEach, test to check if elements are enabled, moved some more methods to CalcStartPage.
